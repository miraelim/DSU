<h1>Mobility-omh User Interface (Visualization of Your Data)</h1>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<p>
  Mobility-omh is a support application for <a href="http://ohmage-omh.smalldata.io/">ohmage-omh</a> that adds personal location tracking and activity classification (e.g. still, walking, running, etc.) Mobility tracks and uploads location data to the ohmage-omh server. Visualizations and statistics are then computed and made available on the dashboard via the ohmage-omh DPU. </br>

  Mobility-omh UI compares today's data with yesterday and shows the difference. It also sets the largest data of the past seven days as the max for four aspects of your Mobility data, Active Minutes, Longest Trek, Hours Out of House, and Miles Walked in the upper part of the interface. In the bottom interface, you could see a list of the locations each with a Google map that you have been in a day with the time interval.
